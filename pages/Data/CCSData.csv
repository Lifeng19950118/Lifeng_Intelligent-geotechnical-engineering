There is also an integrated Direct Air Capture (DAC) project. Acorn CCS proposes a low-cost, minimum viable, full chain, integrated industrial CCS facility based largely on re-use of existing assets, from which a more extensive network can be built. The Acorn project is the transport and storage backbone of the Scottish Cluster. Initial phase involves existing amine-based gas separation plant at St Fergus, which currently vents CO2 separated from incoming North Sea gas, which can be developed to capture other emissions from existing or new facilities at the site. The Goldeneye pipeline will be re-purposed to transport CO2 to a new injection well in the Central North Sea. The DAC project is a collaboration (since 2020) with Carbon Engineering to create a 1MtCO2/yr removal facility that will 'plug in' to the Acorn project infrastructure. Acorn Hydrogen proposes to produce hydrogen by reforming natural gas and capturing the CO2 emissions. The hydrogen will be blended with natural gas in the national transmission system at St Fergus; the CO2 will be stored as part of Acorn CCS.

FuelCell Energy were also selected by DoE in 2015 for funding of a pilot project to use fuel cells on coal power flue gases. The fuel cell system design essentially oxidises methane to CO2 in the fuel cell, but requires a CO2 input to it's process cycle, which can be taken from a dilute flue gas. This results in concentration of the CO2 in the flue gas while generating additional power. In October 2016 the site for a pilot plant was announced as Plant Barry generating station, a mixed gas and coal burning power station on the Mobile River. The station is already the site of a post-combustion pilot plant (see separate entry).

However, in April 2011 Vattenfall committed to limiting emmissions from the plant to the level of a modern gas plant, and delayed the operation of the coal plant until 2020 in a binding agreement with environmental organisations. Hence, the initial project comprised three CCGT units built from 2011 and opened in 2013; a decision on the second phase to introduce coal/biomass gasification was to come later but is now unlikely. United States of Americage of the CCGT units has been low due to high gas prices and lower efficiency in this plant than alternative stations. Jul'17, no further news on gasification proposals, however, new project announced between Statoil, Gasunie and Vattenfall to evaluate conversion of one unit of plant to run on hydrogen. Conversion of natural gas to hydrogen most likely by SMR at Eemshaven with shipping of liquefied CO2 to Norway for storage. Jan'18 Mitsubishi/Hitachi Power Systems join project to adapt turbine(s) for hydrogen. Jul'18, Jacobs awarded contract for feasibility study by (now) Equinor. Study will cover design of a full-scale value chain including hydrogen production, CO2 capture and export and conversion of one turbine unit to hydrogen combustion. Up to 3 Mtpa CO2 capture expected.

This incentivised the capture and storage of CO2 from offshore gas extraction facilities.,"Statoil with ExxonMobil, Total","Sleipner was the world's first offshore CCS facility. The natural gas extracted at Sleipner contains around 9% CO2, which is separated using amine scrubbers and injected into Utsira saline formation 800m below the seabed. Approximately 2,800 tonnes of CO2 are seperated and injected daily. Sleipner passed its 20th anniversary in 2016 and over 17 million tonnes of CO2 have been injected and stored to date (2017), with extensive monitoring of the CO2 plume carried out. CO2 from the nearby Alfa Nord field is also separated in the Sleipner system and the Gudrun field was added to the cluster in 2014.
